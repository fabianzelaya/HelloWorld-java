# :earth_americas: "Hello, World!" Java :coffee:

My first "Hello, World" Java program.

A `"Hello, World!"` program is generally a computer program that outputs or displays the message `"Hello, World!"`. This program is very simple to write in many programming languages, and is often used to illustrate a language's basic syntax. `"Hello, World!"` programs are often the first a student learns to write in a given language, and they can also be used as a sanity test to ensure computer software intended to compile or run source code is correctly installed, and that its operator understands how to use it.

[Lesson: The "Hello, World!" Application](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/getStarted/cupojava/index.html)

```java
// My first Java program

public class helloWorld {
    // Output "Hello, World!" to the counsole
    public static void main(String[] args) { // Method
        System.out.println("Hello, " + args[0]);
        //System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
// FZ

// Outputs "Hello, World!"
```
